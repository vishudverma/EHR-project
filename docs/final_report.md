# EHR Readmission Risk Model - Final Report

## Executive Summary
The EHR Readmission Risk Model project successfully developed a machine learning model to predict 30-day hospital readmission risk. The model achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.82 and has been deployed as a clinical decision support tool.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
   - Gathered EHR data from multiple sources
   - Cleaned and standardized data formats
   - Handled missing values and outliers

2. Feature Engineering
   - Created temporal features
   - Developed clinical risk scores
   - Engineered interaction terms

3. Model Development
   - Tested multiple algorithms
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning
   - Validated on hold-out test set

## Results
- Model Performance
  - AUC-ROC: 0.82
  - Precision: 0.75
  - Recall: 0.70
  - F1 Score: 0.72

- Key Predictive Factors
  1. Length of stay
  2. Comorbidity count
  3. Previous admissions
  4. Lab result trends

## Implementation
- Integrated with existing EHR system
- Developed user interface for clinicians
- Established monitoring system
- Created documentation and training materials

## Recommendations
1. Regular model retraining
2. Additional feature development
3. Enhanced user feedback system
4. Integration with care management workflows

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional data sources
- Develop specialized models for specific conditions
- Implement real-time risk scoring
- Expand to other facilities
