# EHR Readmission Risk Model - Project Proposal

## Background
Hospital readmissions are a significant healthcare challenge, leading to increased costs and reduced quality of care. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict patient readmission risk using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.

## Objectives
1. Develop a reliable predictive model for 30-day readmission risk
2. Identify key factors contributing to readmission
3. Create an interpretable model for clinical decision support
4. Implement a user-friendly interface for healthcare providers

## Business Case
- Reduce healthcare costs by preventing unnecessary readmissions
- Improve patient outcomes through early intervention
- Support clinical decision-making with data-driven insights
- Meet regulatory requirements for quality care

## Technical Approach
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Development
4. Validation and Testing
5. Implementation and Deployment

## Expected Outcomes
- Accurate readmission risk predictions
- Actionable insights for healthcare providers
- Reduced readmission rates
- Cost savings for healthcare organizations

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Data Collection and Cleaning (2 months)
- Phase 2: Model Development (3 months)
- Phase 3: Testing and Validation (2 months)
- Phase 4: Implementation (1 month)

## Resources Required
- Data Science Team
- Clinical Subject Matter Experts
- Computing Infrastructure
- Data Storage Solutions
